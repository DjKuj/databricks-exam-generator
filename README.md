# Databricks exam generator

Welcome to this project dedicated to generating exams for the [Databricks Certified Data Engineer Association certification](https://www.databricks.com/learn/certification/data-engineer-associate).

All questions have been scrapped from the Databricks academy. You can adapt the number of questions from each theme directly from the sidebar.

To run the app locally, create a virtual env and install the requirements using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then launch the dashboard with:

```
streamlit run Introduction.py
```

The dashboard should open directly on your default browser but you can access it [here](http://localhost:8501/).
